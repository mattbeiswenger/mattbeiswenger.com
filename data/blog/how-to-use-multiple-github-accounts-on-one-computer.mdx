title: How To Use Multiple GitHub Accounts on One Computer
description: Learn how to setup your computer to use remote repositories from multiple GitHub accounts

Recently I _finally_ got around to creating a [dotfiles](https://github.com/mattbeiswenger/dotfiles) repo to backup my config files and share them across machines. I wanted to be able share these configurations between my work and personal computer, but unfortunately I use a separate GitHub account for work (security reasons, I guess ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) than I do for personal projects.

Not only did I want to simply share configurations, but I also wanted to:

1. Link commits made from my work computer to my personal GitHub account
2. Authenticate via SSH

## Choosing a Primary Account

The best way to setup your machine for two GitHub accounts is to **think in terms of a primary account**. So how do you pick your primary account? Your primary account is simply the account that you will be cloning most repos from. For me, the primary account on my work computer is my work GitHub account.

## Configuring Primary Account

If you already have your primary account setup (and it's likely that you do), then you can probably skip this section. If not, or you just want to appreciate my wordsmithery, then by all means stick around.

### Generating SSH Key

One thing to note is that you can't use the same SSH key for multiple GitHub accounts. If you do, you'll see the following error.

First, you'll want to generate an SSH key. GitHub has way more comprehensive documentation so I'll just refer you to them for this part. Essentially you'll want to:

1. [Generate an SSH key and add to the authentication agent](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. [Add the SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
3. [Test the connection](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection) (or just wing it)

## Configuring Other Accounts

You can use these methods to configure add as many GitHub accounts as you'd like.
