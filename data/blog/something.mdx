Notes for **Pro Ember Data: Getting Ember Data to Work with Your API** by [David Tang](https://twitter.com/iamdtang)

### Chapter 1: Ember Data Overview

- You access data through the **store** which also provides caching with data normalization
- By default, routes and controllers have access to the store
- The store can be injected into other parts of the application through dependency injection (ex. `@service store`)
- The **adapter** exists between the store and your API. It defines where the API data comes from. The adapter can be easily swapped if your API source or implementation changes. Follows the [[Adapter Pattern]].
- The **serializer** exists between the adapter and the API and handles _serialization_ and _normalization_ of data between the API and client.
- Built in model transforms include string, number, boolean, and date
- By default, Ember Data uses [[JSONAPI]] for both adapter and serializer

### Chapter 2: Talking to APIs with Adapters

- Ember Data ships with two adapters:
  1.  <InlineLink url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCABThOhGm4/" newTab>
        RESTAdapter
      </InlineLink>
  2.  JSONAPIAdapter

**Adapter Methods an Corresponding Store Methods**

| Adapter Method   | Invoked By                             |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `findAll()`      | `store.findAll()`                      |
| `findRecord()`   | `store.findRecord()`                   |
| `createRecord()` | `model.save()`                         |
| `updateRecord()` | `model.save() (if the model has an ID` |
| `deleteRecord()` | `model.destroyRecord()`                |
| `query()`        | `store.query()`                        |
| `queryRecord()`  | `store.queryRecord`                    |

- In the JSONAPI and REST adapters, you can set `coalesceFindRequests = true` to request for multiple related objects at the same time instead of the default behavior of sending a new request for each related object.
- There are four methods you can override from the `Adapter` class that allow you to customize the background reloading behavior
  1.  `shouldBackgroundReloadAll()`
  2.  `shouldBackgroundReloadRecord`
  3.  `shouldReloadAll()`
  4.  `shouldReloadRecord()`
- All of these methods default to true. The last two take precedence over the previous two.

### Chapter 3: API Response Formats and Serializers

- Ember Data comes with three built-in serializers
  1.  JSONSerializer
  2.  RESTSerializer
  3.  JSONAPISerializer
- These serializers vary with how they send and receive data from the server
