title: Deploying to Multiple Server Environments in Ember
description: Learn how to deploy your Ember application to multiple environments by separating your build environment from your deployment environment

Ember CLI allows you to build your Ember application for different environments
by passing a `--environment` option to the `ember build` command. For example, if
we wanted to build for a production environment we would run the command
`ember build --environment production`.

We can then configure our environment variables in `config/environment.js`. If
we wanted to configure an API endpoint for different environments, we could
do the following:

```javascript
import ENV from 'my-app/config/environment'

if (ENV.environment === 'development') {
  ENV.APP.API_HOST = 'http://localhost:8000'
}

if (ENV.environment === 'production') {
  ENV.APP.API_HOST = 'https://www.myserver.com/api'
}
```

This works great for applications that only deploy to one server. But what if
we wanted to deploy to a staging server? You might think that you can do this:

```javascript
import ENV from 'my-app/config/environment'

// DO NOT DO THIS
if (ENV.environment === 'staging') {
  ENV.APP.API_HOST = 'https://staging.myserver.com/api'
}
```

This will deceivingly work, but it's bad practice. This is because Ember
actually ships with only three build environments:

1. `test`
2. `development`
3. `production`

When one of these environments aren't passed as the `--environment` option,
Ember CLI defaults to the development environment but will still run the
logic for the passed environment in `config/environments.js`. So,
in the example above, the API endpoint will correctly be set
to `https://staging.myserver.com/api`, but the application will be built as a
development environment. This means that we lose important benefits of building as
a production environment such as [minifying](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/asset-compilation/#minifying)
and [fingerprinting](https://cli.emberjs.com/release/advanced-use/asset-compilation/#fingerprintingandcdnurls) files.

The problem is that the example code above **conflates the Ember build environment
with the deployment environment**. This is fine if you have one production
environment but becomes a problem when you want to deploy to multiple
environments. So what are we supposed to do? The solution is to use the
popular community addon `ember-cli-deploy`.

`ember-cli-deploy` allows us to separate the build environment from the
deployment environment by exposing an `ember deploy` command. You can install
the addon by running `ember install ember-cli-deploy`. After installation, a
`config/deploy.js` file will automatically be created with the following content:

```javascript
/* eslint-env node */
'use strict'

module.exports = function (deployTarget) {
  let ENV = {
    build: {},
    // include other plugin configuration that applies to all deploy targets here
  }

  if (deployTarget === 'development') {
    ENV.build.environment = 'development'
    // configure other plugins for development deploy target here
  }

  if (deployTarget === 'staging') {
    ENV.build.environment = 'production'
    // configure other plugins for staging deploy target here
  }

  if (deployTarget === 'production') {
    ENV.build.environment = 'production'
    // configure other plugins for production deploy target here
  }

  // Note: if you need to build some configuration asynchronously, you can return
  // a promise that resolves with the ENV object instead of returning the
  // ENV object synchronously.
  return ENV
}
```

As you can see, we now have access to a `deployTarget` variable separate from the
build environment. We provide this variable by passing it to the
`ember deploy` command. So, for example, if we wanted to deploy to our
staging environment we would run `ember deploy staging`.

And that's it! I know that the difference between build and deploy environments
was not entirely obvious to me when I first started deploying Ember
applications so hopefully this helped to eliminate some confusion.
And, now that you have `ember-cli-deploy` installed, I would highly suggest
looking at the other capabilities of the addon. It has a
[rich plugin ecosystem](http://ember-cli-deploy.com/plugins/) that can help
you with tasks like gzipping, uploading to S3, sending deploy
notifications, and more.
