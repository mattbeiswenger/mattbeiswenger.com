## Syntax

The `useState` hook is the most simple and commonly used React hook. It's used to store a single state variable and is used like so:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
```

As you can see, the `useState` hook returns an array with two values. We're able to assign these values into `count` and `setCount` variables
using the [destructuring assignment syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).
The following code, while slightly more verbose, will achieve the same result as above:

```jsx
const state = useState(0)
const count = state[0]
const setCount = state[1]
```

It's also important to note that we can name `count` and `setCount` to whatever we want, but convention
suggests to use `<variable>` and `set<Variable>`.

## Return Values

The _first_ value in the array, which we're assigning to `count` is a single state variable.

The _second_ value, `setCount`, is a function
that sets the value of the state variable. If we wanted to change the count to 2 we would invoke the function as `setCount(2)`.

Here's an example
of using the `setCount()` function to increment and decrement the state variable using two buttons.

<Example1 />

## Setting the Same Value

Whenever the `setCount()` function is called with a new value, the component will re-render in order to display the updated value. Note
that this will only happen if the value passed to `setCount()` is different from the current one.

  You can view the logs by either opening the developer tools in your browser or
  by opening the CodeSandbox by clicking the
  <ArrowTopRightOnSquareIcon className="w-4 h-4 inline-flex items-center" /> icon
  and opening the console tab

## Setting State With a Function

The setter function returned by `useState` can also take in a function where the argument is the previous state value:

```jsx
setCount((previousCount) => previousCount + 1)
```

This is actually good practice when setting the state based on a previous value (even though I didn't do it in my other examples ðŸ˜¬). The reason
why this is good practice is that there can be unexpected state updates if there is a delay between the function call and the call to the setter.
This is a bit complicated, so here's an example to better illustrate.

  Kent C Dodd's has [a great blog
  post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-state-lazy-initialization-and-function-updates#dispatch-function-updates)
  about this that the following example is derived from
</Callout>

In the example below, if you press the "Increment" button quickly three times (within the 500ms limit), you'll notice
that the count only increments by one.

<Example3 />

in order to rectify this problem, we can use `setCount(previousCount => previousCount + 1)`. Try adding this to the example
above to ensure that the button clicks increment the count correctly.

## Arguments

The `useState` hook takes in a single argument that sets the initial value of the state variable on first render. It can also, however,
take in a function. If a function is passed it will [lazily initialize](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#lazy-initial-state) the initial
value.

## Lazy Initialization

Lazy initialization is helpful when the initial value passed into the `useState()` hook is computationally expensive.
To illustrate this concept, assume we have the following component.

<Example4 />

Even though the initial value gets disregarded on
subsequent renders, the function that creates the initial value still runs. This can be problematic if we
have initial values that are expensive to calculate because they can cause a significant delay when
rendering our components.

To calculate the initial value on only the first render and not on subsequent renders, we can pass a function
to the `useState` hook.

<Example5 />

If you check the logs in the example above, you'll see that even though the component re-renders, the
initialization function does not get called.

Note that you should probably only use this if you're noticing significant render delays in your components,
otherwise it's best practice to pass the value without lazy initialization.
