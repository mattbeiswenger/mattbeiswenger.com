title: Setting Up Multiple Git Accounts on One Computer

## Why Setup Multiple Git Accounts?

So I have two GitHub accounts, [one for my personal projects](https://github.com/mattbeiswenger) and one for work (we're required to do this for security reasons ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
I also have two machines, a [personal desktop](/uses) and a work laptop.

Two accounts, two machines, one account per machine right? I mean that's just good work-life balance. Or so I thought.

I often found myself wanting to reference my personal projects while working on work projects.
I wanted to not just read the code on GitHub but clone my repos and play with the code to see how I solved certain problems.
I also wanted to be able to make commits with the appropriate accounts as the author. So, here's how I was able to set that up.

## Choosing a Primary Account

The best way to think about this is that you have a primary account and a secondary account. Your primary account will
be the account you use most often on that computer. You likely already have your primary account setup on your computer.
